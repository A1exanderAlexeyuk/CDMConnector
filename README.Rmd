> Are you using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) with an OMOP Common Data Model? 
>
> Interact with your CDM in a pipe-friendly way with CDMConnector.
>
> - Quickly connect to your CDM and start exploring.
> - Build data analysis pipelines using familiar dplyr verbs.
> - Easily extract subsets of CDM data from a database.


## Overview

CDMConnector introduces a single R object that represents an OMOP CDM relational database heavily inspired by the [dm](https://cynkra.github.io/dm/) pacakge. The cdm object can be used in dplyr style data analysis pipelines and facilitates interactive data exploration. cdm objects encapsulate references to OMOP CDM tables in a remote RDBMS as well as metadata neccessary for interacting with a CDM.

## Features

CDMConnector is meant to be the entry point for composable tidyverse style data analysis operations on an OMOP CDM. 
A `cdm_reference` object behaves like a named list of tables.

- Quickly create a list of references to a subset of CDM tables
- Store connection information for later use inside functions
- Use any DBI driver backend with the OMOP CDM

See Getting started for more details.


## Installation

CDMConnector can be installed from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("darwin-eu/CDMConnector")
```

## Usage

Create a `cdm_reference` object from any DBI connection.

```{r}
library(CDMConnector)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = eunomia_dir())
cdm <- cdm_from_con(con)
cdm
```

A `cdm_reference` is a named list of table references:

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
names(cdm)
```

Use dplyr verbs with the table references.

```{r}
tally(cdm$person)
```

Compose operations with the pipe.

```{r}
cdm$condition_era %>%
  left_join(cdm$concept, by = c("condition_concept_id" = "concept_id")) %>% 
  count(top_conditions = concept_name, sort = TRUE)
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(con)
```

## Getting help

If you encounter a clear bug, please file an issue with a minimal [reproducible example](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) on [GitHub](https://github.com/OdyOSG/CDMConnector/issues).
